Stringbuilder - mutable
Stringbuffer - mutable and thread-safe
String - immutable and threadsafe by default

String s1 = "geeks"
String s2 = s1;
s1 = s1 + "forgeeks"

STRING
s1==s2 // false
because strings are immutable

STRINGBUILDER/ STRINGBUFFER
s1==s2 // true 
because the same object is modified and does not create a new memory like strings
