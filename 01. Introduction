Released in 1995, one of the most popular programming languages in decades.
it is platform independent .
platform is a combination of OS and architecture (windows+intel)

compile a code and get into a executable code
java converts code to java bytecode which is platform idependent and has JVM(Java virtual machine) on that machine. JVM is pre intstalled. programmer need not worry about computer
specific things. java compilation is simple compared to c, cpp.

Python follows this method. C# by Microsoft also uses this.

3 billion devices, 9 million developers.

c, cpp has mutiples ways to do a thing, in java there are clear rules( primitives and non primitives)
c, cpp have operator overloading while java does not have that

JVM works as a monetoring manager, and takes care of safety compared to c,cpp.

we cannot access memory directly in java, only references.

java is close to c,cpp and different from java.

Java is Statically typed language
has better exceptional handling, and garbage collection

It is difficult to write bad code in java.

handles issues at compilation, and code is maintainable easily that is why it is preferred by lot of developers.
