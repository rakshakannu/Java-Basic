public class Test{
  public static void main(String [] args)
  {
    System.out.print("Hello World"); 
  }
}

// static dont need object to call thats why main is always static.
// java has arguments as array of strings because we can pass strings at command line.
// out is a object
// print is a method

running the code:
~$ javac Test.java

a new file will be generated which is the bytecode named Test

~$ java Test

JVM runs the Test(bytecode file)
