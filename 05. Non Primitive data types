// non primitive data types are classes. these classes can be user defined classes or pre-defined library classes.
ex - System is a predifined class in java

// we create a new object of the class using new.
// we  access the members of the class using dot operator.

// primitive VS non-primitive

non-primitives are references.
primitive data types are not references.

so, variables values changed will be affected in references whereas in primitive data types, it wont be.

non- primitives are always stored in HEAP memory, where as primitives are stored in STACK memory.
Stack memory is used for function calls.
HEAP memory is generally used for dynamic memory allocation. we use the NEW operator to create memory for non-primitive types.

if you wont initialise the members of non-primitive type, they get a default value.
for integer its 0.
boolean its false.
floating its 0.0.
but in primitive type, there is no default value and you will get compiler error.
