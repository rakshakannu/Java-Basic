// the four main classes that implement the list interface are

1. arraylist
2. linkedlist
3. vector
4. stack

list interface inherits from the collections interface

it has some additional methods that are not there in the list interface given below:

get(int index) - to get index of a particular index
set(int index, E element) - replace the element at that index
indexOf(object O) - first index of the item that is there in the list. it will get the leftmost index of the item ( incase the item has repeated )
listIterator() - can move in both the directions, not only forward
listIterator(int index) - gives an iterator from the given position
remove(int index) - remove an item at a particular position
(collection interface remove function takes object as an arguement, and this one takes index as a arguement)

//syntax

List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
