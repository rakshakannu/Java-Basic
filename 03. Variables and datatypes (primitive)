// in java we must specify the datatype before using it. this is not there in python.
// c,cpp, and java are called statically typed languages
// python is called dynamically typed language. in pyhton, it is decided during execution as to how much memory should be allocated. that is why java & cpp programs are 
generally faster than python.

// variable naming
allows a-z, A-Z, _ , $ and numbers. the only rule is that the variable name should not start with numbers. also keywords cannot be used to name them.

// convention in java
to use camelcase.
1. if single word, then all lowercase
2. if they are more than one word in the varable, then the second word will start with a capital letter.
ex - name, nameOfPlayer, ageOfPlayer, currentPlayer.
3. if there is a constant, write it in uppercase, and if there are more than one word, seperate them using _ .
ex - int MAX_AGE = 100;
4. final keyword is used in java for declaring constants.
In Java, the final keyword can be used while declaring an entity. Using the final keyword means that the value can't be modified in the future. This entity can be - but is not 
limited to - a variable, a class or a method.
ex - final int MAX_AGE = 100;

// types of variables in java

1. primitive (int , char, float, double)
2. non - primitive (array, string, any user defined class)

// primitive data types

1. boolean
true/ false

2. byte
a byte is stored using 8 bits. used to store small variables/ values.
(-128 to 127) or (-2^7 to 2^7 - 1 )
out of the 8 bits, one bit is used for sign (the leftmost bit).
in java, negative numbers are stored using 2's compliment representation.

3.  short
this is 16 bit long.
(-32768 to 32767) or (-2^15 to 2^15 -1)

4. int
it is 32 bit

5. long
it is 64 bit

6. big integer (larger than long)

7. float
decimals 

8. double
decimals

9. char
in java, characters are stored using 16 bits.
in c and cpp, characters are 8 bit.
in java, the idea is to allow unicode characters.
the range is (0 to 2^16-1)
the characters are represented using single quotes.

// literals
ex - int x = 10;
here 10 is a literal.
